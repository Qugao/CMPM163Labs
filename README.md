## Lab4
Questions:<br/>
* a. x = U*8
* b. y = u*8
* White<br/><br/>

Cubes (from left to right):
* Cube1: Cube made by following google doc part 1 instructions, it used texture and normal map No.155
* Cube2: Cube made by following google doc part 1 instructions, it used texture No.156
* Cube3: Same as Cube2 but it has a nomral map on it
* Cube4: The final cube, it has a tiling texture onit, it used texture No.176<br/>
I implmented tiling effect by first detect the position of current uv, for exmple, if its x and y are both larger than 0.5 then it means current coordinates are located on the top right corner of the cube. Then I shrink texture down to the bottom-left corner and put it on the top right corner by doing some calculation to its coordinates.
* Cube5: Cube made by following google doc part 2 instructions, it used texture No.176

I added trail for particles and grident color to the particles. Then I added force to their X-axis so they can look like they are blowing away by wind. At last, I gave them a gravity property give them a more dynamic feelings.
